A working prototype of a horizontal scrolling 'Timeline' with a number of features.

Step 1: This branch shows the initial set up of the timeline along with test dates. This was created using Horizontal Timeline by CodyHouse (https://codyhouse.co/gem/horizontal-timeline/). This allows the user to scroll through the timeline, viewing the name of the area and image - this case, it shows a test title, a year and a test image. This was to get the layout and styling done first before advancing onto more features.
