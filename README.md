A working prototype of a horizontal scrolling 'Timeline' with a number of features such as:
- Fully mobile responsive timeline
- When card is clicked a modal or popup appears with additional details
- A draggable navigation bar at the bottom must allow the user to navigate through the timeline (similarto how it progresses the user through a video on YouTube);

All created using Foundation 6 framework.
