A working prototype of a horizontal scrolling 'Timeline' with a number of features.

Step 6: This shows a working timeline with pop-up/modals, tabs, arrows and a feature to drag/scroll through the timeline. Unfortuantly I couldn't get the scroll to work on the initial timeline, so I made a small prototype at the bottom of the page to show thow this works.
