A working prototype of a horizontal scrolling 'Timeline' with a number of features.

Step 4: This branch shows a working timeline with pop ups/modals. Displayed on each pop up/modal there are now 4 different tabs - each tab contains different information when the user clicks through each button. In this example, the first tab displays highlights of the event on the timeline, and the rest is filled with dummy text to show how it works.
