A working prototype of a horizontal scrolling 'Timeline' with a number of features.

Step 5: This is a working timeline with pop-up modals including tabs, that now contains arrows that allows the user to scroll through the additional information for each event from the pop ip/modal. This takes the user to the next and previous event - this saves the user having to exit the pop up/modal, and scroll through the timeline again to click on the image.
