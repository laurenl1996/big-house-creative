A working prototype of a horizontal scrolling 'Timeline' with a number of features.

Step 3: This brance shows a working timeline with pop ups/modals. When the user clicks on the image under each section of the timeline, a pop up/modal appears giving the user test text and a button to allow them to exit the pop up/modal and return to the timeline.
